- 👋 Hi, I’m @foss4ever
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Linux - especially Free and Open Source Software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning things such as Ansible, bash scripting, Graylog log mgmt, and maybe starting to use Git some time soon - just like a real developer :)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything but actual software development for which I don't have the skills.
- 📫 How to reach me: via sending me a message here on Github
