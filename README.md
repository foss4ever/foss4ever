- 👋 Hi, I’m @foss4ever
- 👀 I’m interested in all things Linux - especially Free and Open Source Software.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning things such as Ansible, Bash scripting, Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything apart from full-fledged software development (am a sysadmin, not a developer).
